    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
        <strong><im>Potato Soup. </im></strong>You've never heard of it. I know
        that because I've never heard of it before either. <i>However,</i>
        after I tried this recipe I didn't want to put <b>ANY </b>other liquid
        or solid in my mouth. Why? Because the combination of bacon, <sub>for those 
        without dietary restictions</sub>, egg and the potato <i>goodness </i>will melt
        any thoughts of other food away.
    </p>
    <p>
        With a prep time of <b>15 minutes </b>and cook time of <b>30
        minutes,</b> this is for the lazy <sup>LAZY</sup>people out there!

    </p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound bacon, <ins>chopped</ins></li>
        <li>2 <mark>stalks</mark> celery, <ins>diced</ins></li>
        <li>1 onion, <ins>chopped</ins></li>
        <li>3 <mark>cloves</mark> garlic, <ins>minced</ins></li>
        <li>8 potatoes, <ins>peeled and cubed</ins></li>
        <li>4 <mark>cups</mark> chicken stock, or enough to cover potatoes</li>
        <li>3 <mark>tablespoons</mark> butter</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon <ins>dried</ins> tarragon</li>
        <li>3 <mark>teaspoons</mark> <ins>chopped</ins> fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Place bacon in a Dutch oven and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain bacon pieces on paper towels. Drain off all but 1/4 cup of the bacon grease.</li>
        <li>Cook celery and onion in the reserved bacon drippings until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes. Add cubed potatoes, and toss to coat. Saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Return bacon to the pan, and add enough chicken stock to just cover the potatoes. Cover, and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a separate skillet over medium heat. Whisk in flour. Cook, stirring constantly, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in heavy cream, tarragon, and cilantro. Bring cream mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add cream mixture to the potato mixture; stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Transfer about 1/2 of the soup to a blender and puree. Return to the Dutch oven. Adjust seasonings to taste.</li>
    </ol>
